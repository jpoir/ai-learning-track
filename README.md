# Choosing a specialty


# Other useful skills that might be requested by employers
These skills are not required for a job in ML by any means, but have come up in my career and having a basic understanding of them can really help you interact with other developers on your team

Pick a stack like the MERN stack to implement your projects into a web based format for easier showcasing
- MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS
- PostGreSQL, Firebase are also good database choices to learn depending on what types of data youre looking at
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) is my personal favorite web framework
